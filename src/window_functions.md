# Window functions

A window function is a function that, for each row, computes a scalar result value based on a calculation against a subset of the rows from the underlying query.

```sql
SELECT empid, ordermonth, val,
  SUM(val) OVER(PARTITION BY empid
                ORDER BY ordermonth) AS runval
FROM Sales.EmpOrders;
```

```sql
SELECT empid, ordermonth, val, SUM(val), AVG(val)
FROM Sales.EmpOrders
GROUP BY empid, ordermonth, val
ORDER BY ordermonth;
```

One of the great advantages of window functions is that they donâ€™t hide the detail. This means you can write expressions that mix detail and aggregates. The next example demonstrates this:

```sql
SELECT orderid, custid, val,
  100 * val / SUM(val) OVER() AS pctall,
  100 * val / SUM(val) OVER(PARTITION BY custid) AS pctcust
FROM Sales.OrderValues;
```

# Modifications with TOP and OFFSET-FETCH

* T-SQL supports using the TOP option directly in INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE statements.
* The OFFSET-FETCH filter is not allowed directly in modifications because this filter requires an ORDER BY clause and modification statements donâ€™t support one.
